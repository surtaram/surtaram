1st section :- setting :- under this we need to library
2nd section :- varibale :- we define variable which is commanly used in every section
3rd section :- we define test case
4th section :- inside this we will define own keywords

All these section we can create in single robot file or we can create in multiple file depending on project
 need .
***Not every section is mandatory.


Working with web elements:--

Text box/input box
    -visibility status
    -enabled status
    -provide value
    -clearing value

    -Verify title of the page

Working with radio and check box

Working with drop down and list boxes
    --> Three method we have to handle drop down
        1. select from list by label
        2. select from list by index
        3.select from list by value

Wait and TimeOuts   :- selenium speed ,selenium timeout ,implicit wait,sleep

selenium speed ---> set selenium speed --> This is applicable for across all element
selenium timeout ---> wait until page contains by default time is 5 sec
implicit wait--> set selenium implicit wait --> element by default wait for 0 sec but when when element not
found , then it will till element found within mentioned times


How to close single and multiple browser :--

this keyword will use :-  close browser and close all browser

How to handle alerts?

How to handle Frames?

How to handle Tabbed windows?
How to handle Browser windows?

Captured element screen shot
This keyword we use :-
    --->  Capture Element Screenshot
Captured Page screen shot
This keyword we use:--
    --->    Capture Page Screenshot

Mouse actions:--
 ---> Right click
Keyword:-- Open Context Menu
 ---> Double click
Keyword:- Double Click Element
 ---> Drag and Drop

User defined Keywords
 --> User defined  keyword without Arguments
 --> User defined keyword with arguments
 --> User defined keyword with arguments & Return value

Scrolling page using JavaScriptExecutor
 ---> Scrolling page till it reach a pixel number
 use "Execute Javascript" keyword and fundtion window.scrollTo(horizonal_pixel.vertical_scroll)
 ---> Scrolling page till find element on page
 ---> Scroll page till the bottom

For loop in robot framework :-
Count number link present on web page
Extract all the links from page
Working with HTML Table
    - Count number of rows in table
    - Count number of columns in table
    - Get data from table
    - Validation on table

Data Driven testing :-
    -Specify test data in the scripts
    - Read test data from excel file (.xlsx)
    - Read test data from csv file(.csv)

Interview question :-
1. Can you explain how you approach designing test cases in Robot Framework for web applications?
 Ans:- I start by thoroughly understanding the requirements and user stories. Then, I identify
 test scenarios and break them down into smaller, manageable test cases. I structure these test
 cases using Robot Framework's keyword-driven approach, ensuring each step is represented by a
 reusable keyword. This approach enhances maintainability and reusability in the test suite.

2.What factors do you consider when creating a test strategy for a web application using
 Robot Framework?
 Ans:- Factors considered include application complexity, critical features, supported browsers,
  and deployment environments. I also take into account the testing scope (regression, smoke, or
   exploratory testing), and any specific testing needs like performance or security testing.

3. How do you prioritize test cases in a given sprint or release cycle?
Ans:- Test case prioritization involves considering business priorities,
 critical functionalities, and areas prone to changes. I collaborate with
 the development team to identify high-risk areas. High-priority test cases
 cover critical paths and functionalities that have a direct impact on end-users.

4. Explain the concept of keyword-driven testing in Robot Framework.
        How do you organize and manage keywords in your test suite?
5. Can you provide an example of a complex test scenario and how you
would break it down into reusable keywords?
6. Discuss the advantages and challenges of using keyword-driven testing in a web testing context.
7. How do you handle dynamic elements on a web page in your Robot Framework test scripts?
8.Can you provide examples of strategies you've used to deal with
dynamic IDs or changing attributes in your test automation?
9. Share your experience in handling AJAX calls and asynchronous behavior during web testing.
10.Explain how you implement data-driven testing in Robot Framework for web applications.
11.What are the different ways to manage test data, and which approach do you prefer?

and how did you address them?
13.How do you integrate Robot Framework with other tools or frameworks
for a comprehensive testing solution?
14. Have you worked with any Continuous Integration (CI) tools, and how did you
incorporate Robot Framework into the CI/CD pipeline?
15.Share an example where you used Robot Framework in conjunction with
 a browser automation tool or a test management tool.
16. How do you handle multiple browser windows or pop-ups in Robot Framework?
17.Can you provide an example of a test scenario involving interactions
 with multiple browser instances?
18. Discuss any challenges you've faced in managing browser windows during your automation testing.
19.What are some best practices you follow while writing Robot Framework
 test scripts for web applications?
20. How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in your test automation suite?
21. Share your experience with code reviews and how they have contributed to
 improving the overall test automation framework.
